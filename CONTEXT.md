# workstate

A live dashboard for agent work: agents report multi-step tasks to a project page, people watch it update. Terms below are binding vocabulary; the contracts are `docs/api.md` (types, HTTP, stream, client files), `docs/client.md` (client, CLI, MCP) and `docs/ui.md` (dashboard helpers). Where this file and a contract disagree, the contract wins.

## Language

**Project**:
A dashboard page. Its UUID is also the public view URL (`/p/<id>`). Holds a Config, Tasks and an event log.

**Write key**:
The secret returned once when a Project is created; the server keeps only its sha256. Whoever holds it can write; the public URL alone is read-only.

**Task**:
One multi-step job on a Project, with its own explicit State set by agents. Identified by a server-generated UUID.

**Node**:
A Step or Subtask in a Task's tree. Addressed by Path; created on first write, along with any missing ancestors.

**Step**:
A Node at depth 1.

**Subtask**:
A Node at depth 2 or deeper, under a Step or another Subtask.

**Path**:
Agent-chosen keys joined by `/` that address a Node within a Task (`chunk-2`, `chunk-2/tests`).

**State**:
A key from the Project's Config, set on a Task or Node. Its label, color, icon and animation come from the Config; an unknown key renders with a fallback.

**Kind**:
The meaning of a State: `pending`, `active`, `blocked`, `failed` or `done`. Behaviour (finished, stale, settled) keys off Kind, never off the State key.

**Tag**:
Short colored text attached to a Node, such as `round 2`.

**Preset**:
A named starting Config. `build-it` is the default.

**Config**:
A Project's theme, initial State and ordered State definitions. Replaced whole or patched, and the change is itself an Event.

**Event**:
A full-row snapshot after a write (Config, Task or Node), numbered by a per-Project `seq`.

**seq**:
The Project-wide event counter. A client that remembers the last `seq` it saw can resume without gaps.

**Stream**:
`GET /api/projects/:id/stream`, server-sent Events with replay from a `seq`.

**Idle**:
A Stream with no writes for the idle window ends with an `idle` event; the page stops following until reloaded.

**Stale**:
A Task not in a `done` or `failed` Kind whose newest update, across itself and its Nodes, is older than the stale window. A display judgement made in the browser.

**Registry**:
`projects.json` and `tasks.json` in the client config dir: which Project a repo reports to, with its Write key, and which server and Project each Task belongs to.

**Handle**:
A Task's Registry entry (`server`, `projectId`). Later writes go to the Handle's server and never re-run Discovery.

**Discovery**:
How the client picks a server at task start: the pinned `WORKSTATE_URL` if set, else the first healthy probe of the local tracker, then the hosted one.

**Pin**:
Setting `WORKSTATE_URL`. Discovery then uses that server only and never falls back.
